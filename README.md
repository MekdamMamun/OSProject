6. You will see the [README file](./README.md) file. One is a preview of how it looks like on the web, and the other is the editing view in markdown language. 
7. Edit the [README file](./README.md). Make sure you have your group details correct, ie, group name, section and team members along with their matric IDs. 
8. Once you have finish editing, click File->Save or ***ctrl-s*** to save it. 
9. After saving, you will notice an M or U next to your file. You will need to commit any changes, whenever you make changes so that it is uploaded to the github repository.

10. Click on the source control, hint: its on the left side panel, and it will list down the files that have been modified or updated. Click on commit. It will then ask you "Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?" Just say yes, and a new tab will appear. Type a message to log what you have done, and click on the check mark.

## Running your own container instance.

1. At the terminal, run a linux instance. By typing the following command. 
```
docker pull debian
docker run --detach -it debian
```
2. This will run the debian container. To check if the debian container is running, type
```bash
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             romantic_jackson
```

3. Keep note of the name used by your container, this is usually given random names unless you specify your own name. Now run a bash command on the container. Make sure you use the name of your container instead of the one shown here. 
```bash
docker exec -i -t romantic_jackson /bin/bash
```

4. Create a file on the container. First you must make sure you are in the bash command prompt of the container. The container is new, and does not have any software other than the debian OS. To create a new file, you will need an editor installed. In the bash shell of the container, run the package manager apt-get to install nano text editor. 

```bash
root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get update      

root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get install nano

root@f65be1987f84:~# cd /root

root@f65be1987f84:~# nano helloworld.txt
```

5. Edit your helloworld.txt, create your messsage and save by typing ctrl-X. Once saved, explore using the container to see where the file is located. Then exit the shell, by typing **exit**.

6. Stop the container and run **docker ps -a**, and restart the container again. Is your file in the container still available?
```bash 
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker stop romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    19 minutes ago   Exited (137) 18 seconds ago             romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker restart romantic_jackson
```

7. Stop the container and delete the container. What happened to your helloworld.txt?

```bash 
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker stop romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    19 minutes ago   Exited (137) 18 seconds ago             romantic_jackson

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker rm romantic_jackson
```

***Questions:***

1. Are files in the container persistent. Why not?. ***(1 mark)*** __Files in a container are typically not persistent by default because containers are designed to be stateless and ephemeral, prioritizing scalability and reproducibility over persistent storage.__.
2. Can we run two, or three instances of debian linux? . ***(1 mark)*** __Yes__.

## Running your own container with persistent storage

1. In the previous experiment, you might have notice that containers are not persistent. To make storage persistent, you will need to mount them. 
At the terminal, create a new directory called **myroot**, and run a instance of debian linux and mount myroot to the container. Find out the exact path of my root, and mount it as the root folder in the debian container. 
2. Create a file in /root on the container, the files should also appear in myroot of your host VM.

```bash 
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ mkdir myroot
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ cd myroot/
@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ pwd
/workspaces/OSProject/myroot

@joeynor ➜ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ docker run --detach -it -v /workspaces/OSProject/myroot:/root debian
```

***Questions:***

1. Check the permission of the files created in myroot, what user and group is the files created in docker container on the host virtual machine? . ***(2 mark)***
@MekdamMamun ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ ls -l
total 28
-rw-rw-rw-  1 codespace codespace    32 Jan 28 15:04  helloworld.txt
@MekdamMamun ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ id
uid=1000(codespace) gid=1000(codespace) groups=1000(codespace),106(ssh),107(docker),988(pipx),989(python),990(oryx),991(golang),992(sdkman),993(rvm),994(php),995(conda),996(nvs),997(nvm),998(hugo),999(dotnet)
3. Can you change the permission of the files to user codespace.  You will need this to be able to commit and get points for this question. ***(2 mark)***
```bash
//use sudo and chown
sudo chown -R codespace:codespace myroot

```
*** @MekdamMamun ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ sudo chown -R codespace:codespace helloworld.txt
@MekdamMamun ➜ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ '''
> ***

## You are on your own, create your own static webpage

1. Create a directory called webpage in your host machine
2. Inside the directory, create a page index.html, with any content you would like
3. Then, run the apache webserver and mount the webpage directory to it. Hint:
```bash
## the -p 8080:80 flag points the host port 8080 to the container port 80

docker run --detach -v /workspaces/OSProject/webpage:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ -p 8080:80 httpd
```

4. If it works, codespace will trigger a port assignment and provide a URL for you to access your webpage like the one below.

5. You can also see the Port in the **PORTS** tab, next to the terminal tab.

6. You can then access your website by adding an index.html towards the end of your url link, like the one below. 

 <img src="./images/helloworldweb.png" width="70%">

***Questions:***

1. What is the permission of folder /usr/local/apache/htdocs and what user and group owns the folder? . ***(2 mark)*** __file:///D:/OS/GROUP%20project/HTML%20file/index.html__.
2. What port is the apache web server running. ***(1 mark)*** =8080
3. What port is open for http protocol on the host machine? ***(1 mark)***="80"

## What to submit

1. Make sure to commit all changes on your source control, and make sure your source control is sync to the repository. 
2. Check your repository link, to see if all the files and answers are included in the repository. 
3. Submit through italeem, by providing the link to your repository.
4. Due by ***31 January, 2024***
